Increase in Grid capacity
=========================
Problem
-------
- Basic function of the grid is to connect the generation to the load.
- World population is set to grow to 10 billion in the next 30 years. This means that the demand for electricity will grow along with it
- Climate change has forced governments all over the world to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Hence, we will see al lot of electric vehicles and renewable sources of energy.
- Renewables have a lot of variability and hence the peak/average ratio is very high. hence, more stress on the transmission grid
- Decentralized energy production requires the distrbution system to changes from a unidirectional system to a bidirectional one.

Solution
--------
- A very straightforward way is to invest in grid modernization by building more transmission lines/corridors for evacuating power from far away places (Eg: Offshore wind farms)
- Another way is to delay these investments by utilizing the existing grid in a much more effective way (Eg: HVDC and FACTS)
- Another possibility is to monitor the existing grid and utilize the entire transmission capacity without comprimising on reliability and security of supply.
