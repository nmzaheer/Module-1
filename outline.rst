Increase in Grid capacity
=========================
Problem
-------
- Basic function of the grid is to connect the generation to the load.
- World population is set to grow to 10 billion in the next 30 years. This means that the demand for electricity will grow along with it
- Climate change has forced governments all over the world to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels. Hence, we will see a lot of electric vehicles and renewable sources of energy.
- Renewables have a lot of variability and hence the peak/average ratio is very high. hence, more stress on the transmission grid
- Decentralized energy production requires the distrbution system to changes from a unidirectional system to a bidirectional one.

Solution
--------
- A very straightforward way is to invest in grid modernization by building more transmission lines/corridors for evacuating power from far away places (Eg: Offshore wind farms)
- Another way is to delay these investments by utilizing the existing grid in a much more effective way (Eg: HVDC and FACTS)
- Another possibility is to monitor the existing grid and utilize the entire transmission capacity without comprimising on reliability and security of supply.(Eg: Dynamic Line Rating)

Influence of reliablity of power supply
=======================================
Problem
-------
- No situational awareness
- Variability of renewables energy production
- Ageing infrastructure

Solution
--------
- Microgrids -- island operation
- Geo-mapping of faults,Intelligent switching, FLISR,Distribution transforemer monitoring
- PMUs in the grid, faster communication
- Better visualization software

Increase efficiency of the grid
===============================
Problem
-------
- High T&D losses

Solution
--------
- FACTS and HVDC, UHVAC is also an option
- Optimal power flow will require faster algorithms and data to run the system efficiently

Changes to allow more DER in the grid
=====================================
- Demand response
- Bidirectional power flow in the distribution side
- Grid-level storage capability
- Integration of PHEV/BEV into the grid

Larger flexibilities in energy trading
======================================
- Demand response
- Storage
- Asset monitoring and optmization
- Creation of new markets


Impact of EVs on the grid
=========================
- Increase in base load
- Can be used for grid storage
- May result in higher peak demand
- Charging stations will require a lot of power in a short time for fast charging
